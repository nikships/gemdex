# gemdex-web

The **web manager**: a browser UI for managing a Gemdex memory pool — list,
search, read, create, edit, **delete**, download transcript attachments, and
**upload agent chat sessions for the deployment to digest** — gated by the same
single-user Google login as [`gemdex-mcp-http`](../mcp-http/README.md).

It replaces the SwiftUI desktop app as the primary human surface for a
self-hosted deployment, and it is the **only** place deletion is exposed. The
agent-facing MCP tools deliberately have no delete (see the root `AGENTS.md`).

```
   browser ──session cookie──▶ gemdex-web ──/v1 bearer──▶ gemdex-server ──▶ gemdex-core
   (Google login)              (this package:            (BYOI, :8765)      (the engine)
                                React SPA + FastAPI BFF)
```

Internals and the reasoning behind the design are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
This file is operational: how to configure and run it.

## The one thing to understand

**The browser never gets the BYOI token.** The backend is a
*backend-for-frontend*: the SPA authenticates to it with a session cookie, and
it authenticates to the BYOI with a server-side bearer that never appears in a
response. The two credentials are completely separate, and the user's Google
token is discarded the moment their identity is verified — it is never
forwarded anywhere.

That is why this is not "a static site plus CORS": the BYOI bearer is a single
long-lived secret granting full access to the entire memory pool, with no
per-user identity. Anything holding it must not be a browser.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `src/gemdex_web/` | The FastAPI BFF (Python). |
| `frontend/` | The React + Vite + TypeScript SPA. |
| `tests/` | `pytest` suite for the BFF. |

In production the built SPA is served *by* the BFF from a single origin, so
there is no CORS configuration and the cookie is same-origin by construction.

## Configuration

Read from the process environment first, then `~/.gemdex/.env` — the same
precedence as every other Gemdex component. **Required values fail fast**: a
missing setting is a startup error naming what is missing, never a silent
fallback.

| Variable | Required | Default | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `GEMDEX_SERVER_TOKEN` | **yes** | — | Bearer for the BYOI `/v1` API. Server-side only. |
| `GEMDEX_SERVER_URL` | no | `http://127.0.0.1:8765` | Where the BYOI server is. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_AUTH` | no | `dev` | `dev` (no login, loopback only) or `google`. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_HOST` | no | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. `dev` mode refuses anything but loopback. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_PORT` | no | `8767` | Bind port. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | `30000` | BYOI request timeout. Session ingest gets its own, much larger budget — one Gemini call per uploaded session. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_STATIC_DIR` | no | bundled `static/` | Built SPA to serve. Unset and absent ⇒ API only. |
| `GEMDEX_STATS_PATH` | no | `~/.gemdex/stats.json` | Read-only `report_outcome` ledger used for stale-memory filters and counts. |

### `google` mode also requires

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth 2.0 **Web application** client ID. |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Its secret (`GOCSPX-…`). |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_BASE_URL` | Public base URL. https required off-loopback. |
| `GEMDEX_ALLOWED_EMAIL` | The one Google account allowed in. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_SESSION_SECRET` | Signs session cookies. ≥32 chars; `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `GEMDEX_WEB_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | Optional, default `43200` (12 h). |

## Reusing the mcp-http Google client

You do **not** need a second OAuth client. One client can hold several
authorized redirect URIs, and the two services use different paths:

| Service | Redirect URI |
|---------|--------------|
| `gemdex-mcp-http` | `https://<mcp-host>/auth/callback` |
| `gemdex-web` | `https://<web-host>/auth/google/callback` |

Add the web one under **APIs & Services → Credentials → your OAuth client →
Authorized redirect URIs**. Google matches these by exact string — no
wildcards, no trailing-slash tolerance. The running server prints the exact
value to register at startup.

As with mcp-http: **the OAuth client cannot be created from any CLI.** It is
console-only. Don't spend time looking for a `gcloud` verb — see the mcp-http
README for the three dead ends.

## Running it

### Development (two processes, no login)

```bash
# 1. the BFF, against a BYOI on loopback
cd packages/web
GEMDEX_SERVER_TOKEN=<byoi-token> uv run gemdex-web

# 2. the SPA, with hot reload, proxying /api and /auth to the BFF
cd packages/web/frontend
pnpm install && pnpm dev      # http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

`GEMDEX_WEB_AUTH` defaults to `dev`, which skips login entirely. It is the
analogue of mcp-http's `static` mode: a loopback convenience. The config layer
**refuses to bind a non-loopback address in `dev` mode**, because doing so
would publish unauthenticated delete to the network.

### Production (one process, real login)

```bash
cd packages/web/frontend && pnpm install && pnpm build   # → ../src/gemdex_web/static
cd packages/web && uv run gemdex-web
```

with `GEMDEX_WEB_AUTH=google` and the variables above set. The BFF serves the
built SPA and the API from one origin.

The supported deployment is the container in [`deploy/`](../../deploy/README.md),
which does both build steps for you.

## Tests

```bash
cd packages/web && uv run pytest          # BFF: auth gate, proxying, leak checks
cd packages/web/frontend && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build
```

The pytest suite mocks the BYOI entirely and never touches the network. It
includes a test that enumerates every `/api` route and asserts each one is
behind the auth dependency, so a new route cannot be added unauthenticated by
omission.

## Uploading chat sessions

**Upload sessions** in the header takes `.jsonl` agent transcripts — or a
`.zip` of them — and turns each into a digested, recallable memory with the
full cleaned transcript attached.

This is the browser half of chat-history ingestion. There are two paths and
they converge:

| | Path A — `gemdex sync-history` | Path B — this page |
|---|---|---|
| Runs on | the developer's laptop | the deployment |
| Needs a Gemini key on | the laptop | `gemdex-server` (already there) |
| Reads sessions from | local `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.factory` | whatever the human uploads |
| Good for | your own machine, repeatable | a machine that never ran the CLI, an exported or shared transcript |

Both produce the **same memory**: same cleaning, same digest prompt, and the
same deterministic `chat:<source>:<sessionId>` id. That id is why re-uploading
a session **updates** it rather than creating a duplicate, and why a session
already synced from a laptop is upserted rather than doubled.

### Where the digesting happens

Not in this service. `POST /api/sessions/upload` decodes the form (expanding
zips) and forwards the transcripts to `POST /v1/sessions/ingest` on
`gemdex-server`, which cleans, digests, and upserts them.

That is because the ingest pipeline is `gemdex-core` — TypeScript — and this
service is Python and cannot import it. Porting it would mean two
implementations of the same digest drifting apart; bundling Node here would put
a second toolchain in a runtime image that deliberately drops it, and a Gemini
key in a third container. **`GEMINI_API_KEY` therefore stays exactly where it
already was: on `gemdex-server`.** This service never sees it.

If the BYOI has no key, an upload answers `503` naming `GEMINI_API_KEY` rather
than a generic failure — recall and browsing keep working, only digesting is
unavailable.

### Limits

| Limit | Value | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Files per request | 25 | One Gemini call each; mirrors the BYOI's own cap. |
| Per file | 24 MiB | A long session is a few MB; larger is a mistake. |
| Per request, total | 64 MiB | Transcripts are held in memory to forward. |

Non-`.jsonl`, non-`.zip` files are rejected by name before any upstream call —
paying for a model call to discover that a screenshot is not a session would be
the expensive way to find out. Zip members are read against their *declared*
uncompressed size (bomb guard), flattened to leaf names, and nested archives are
skipped rather than recursed.

## Ingest history

`GET /api/ingest/history` — the History page. What chat history this pool holds,
per agent and per repo.

**It is derived from the pool, not from a ledger, because no host-side ledger
exists.** `gemdex sync-history` keeps its ledger (`~/.gemdex/ingest.json`, keyed
by absolute path + mtime) on each *laptop*; the host only ever received finished
records. Web upload returns a per-request summary that the browser shows and
discards. So the memories are the only durable record of what was ingested —
which is also the record that cannot drift, needs no new schema, and describes
both paths identically because both write the same kind of memory.

The deterministic `chat:<source>:<sessionId>` id makes this exact: filtering on
that prefix yields precisely the ingested sessions, and the `<source>` segment is
what the ingester wrote rather than something guessed here. Repo and branch come
from the digest's own header line (`Source: … · Repo: … · <date>`), which is the
memory's first line and so survives into the 100-char `preview` — the whole page
costs **one** `GET /v1/memories`, with no per-session fetch.

> **The timestamps are session activity, not ingest time.** A digest keeps the
> transcript's own first/last activity timestamps (`createdAt: meta.firstTs`, and
> `importRecords` preserves them). The host genuinely cannot know when a laptop
> ran sync, so the UI says "active 3d ago" and never "ingested 3d ago". The
> response ships that caveat in `timestampMeaning` so the numbers can't be
> rendered without it.

## Hygiene status

`GET /api/hygiene/status` — reports that hygiene **cannot run against this
deployment**, and where it can. There is no scan button, on purpose.

Hygiene's phase 1 clusters near-duplicates from per-memory vectors via
`MemoryStore.listParentsWithVectors()` — a method on the **local LanceDB** store.
It is not on the `MemoryBackend` interface, `PostgresMemoryBackend` has no
equivalent, and `/v1` exposes no vector-listing route. The `gemdex serve` sidecar
that *does* expose hygiene routes rejects anything but local mode outright. So
host-side hygiene needs a new `/v1` route plus a pgvector clustering
implementation — new infrastructure, and its own decision.

Rather than a control that always fails, the endpoint reports what actually
protects the pool today:

- **Save-time similar-memory detection** (`GEMDEX_SIMILAR_THRESHOLD`, default
  `0.90` — the same cosine scale hygiene clusters on). Duplicate *prevention*,
  running automatically on every save.
- **Ingested sessions cannot duplicate at all**, thanks to the deterministic id.
  Since chat digests dominate a real pool, most of it is structurally
  duplicate-free.
- **Deletion stays a human action** — the same reason no agent tool can delete.

…and the exact command for a real pass (`npx gemdex serve`, or the desktop app),
with the caveat that a local run inspects *that machine's* `~/.gemdex` pool
rather than this one.

## Not in scope here

- **Attachment upload on create/edit.** Create and edit are text-only; the
  file-bearing path is session upload above, where a transcript becomes its own
  digested memory. Existing attachments are readable and downloadable.
- **Running hygiene from the browser**, per above — it needs server-side
  pgvector clustering that does not exist yet.
