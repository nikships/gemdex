"""The BFF's JSON API, under `/api`.

Every route here depends on `require_identity`, so an unauthenticated request
gets a 401 before any BYOI call happens. The shapes are deliberately *not* a
transparent proxy of `/v1`: this layer decides what the browser is allowed to
know, which is what makes it a BFF rather than a CORS hole.

Two rules worth keeping in mind when adding routes:

1. **Never put the BYOI token, or any raw BYOI error body, in a response.**
   `_byoi_http_error` maps upstream failures to a sanitized message.
2. **Search and pagination are server-side.** See `list_memories`.
