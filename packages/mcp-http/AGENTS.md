# AGENTS.md — gemdex-mcp-http

The **Streamable HTTP** surface of Gemdex: a FastMCP v4 (Python) service that
re-exposes the six MCP tools over a URL instead of a stdio pipe, so agents on
other machines can reach the memory layer. Repo-wide context is in the root
`AGENTS.md`; the TS tool contract this package mirrors is in
[`../mcp/AGENTS.md`](../mcp/AGENTS.md).

Read this before editing. Operational setup (env vars, how to run, beta pin
rationale) lives in the [README](README.md) and is not repeated here.

## Where this sits

This is a **third client shell** over the same engine, alongside the TS stdio
server and the desktop sidecar — and like them it owns **no memory logic**:

```
   remote agent ──Streamable HTTP──▶ gemdex-mcp-http ──/v1 bearer──▶ gemdex-server ──▶ gemdex-core
                       /mcp          (this package,                 (BYOI, :8765)     (the engine)
                                      Python)
```

The critical consequence: **this package is Python and talks HTTP, not
`workspace:*`.** It cannot import `gemdex-core`. Every behavior the TS handlers
get for free from a shared library — content edits, relative ages, score lines,
the stats ledger — is **re-implemented here and must be kept in sync by hand**.

## File map (`src/gemdex_mcp_http/`)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `config.py` | `load_config()` — env → frozen `Config`. Fail-fast: raises `ConfigError` rather than booting broken. `EnvSource` mirrors core's `EnvManager` precedence (`process.env` → `~/.gemdex/.env`). |
| `byoi.py` | `ByoiClient` — the async `/v1` client. **The only module that touches the network.** Python analogue of core's `RemoteMemoryBackend`. |
| `formatting.py` | Pure render helpers ported 1:1 from TS `handlers.ts` (+ `apply_content_edits` from core's `content-edits.ts`). No I/O, no state. |
| `stats.py` | `MemoryStatsStore` — the `~/.gemdex/stats.json` outcome ledger, same file/format as core's TS store. |
| `tools.py` | `GemdexTools` — the six wrappers: validate args → call BYOI → render. Mirrors `handlers.ts`. |
| `descriptions.py` | Tool descriptions copied from TS `index.ts`, with the attachment-path caveat swapped in. |
| `auth.py` | `build_auth_provider()` — **the single auth seam.** Static bearer, or `SingleUserGoogleProvider` (OAuth 2.1 + email allowlist). |
| `server.py` | `build_server()` + `main()`. Registers tools + `/healthz` + the sync route, runs `mcp.run(transport="http", …)`. |
| `sync.py` | `POST /mcp/sync/records` — the chat-digest ingest route used by `gemdex sync-history`. Enforces auth itself (custom routes are auth-exempt), validates records, delegates to `ByoiClient.import_records`. **Not a tool.** |

## Three invariants that are easy to break

### 1. Output text is a mirror of `handlers.ts` — change both or neither

`formatting.py` is a deliberate line-for-line port. An agent must get the same
bytes from `recall` whether it connected over stdio or HTTP, because the tool
descriptions teach it to read those exact lines (`Scores: fused=…`, `⚠ track
record: …`, `updated: 3d ago`). If you change a render rule in one package,
change it in the other in the same commit. The unit tests here assert on the
literal strings for exactly this reason.

Same applies to `apply_content_edits` (ported from core's `content-edits.ts`) and
`stats.py` (ported from core's `memory-stats-store.ts` — same on-disk file, so a
format divergence corrupts the ledger the TS server also reads).

### 2. Attachment `path` is rejected, not resolved

The TS tools accept a local file `path` and prefer it, because agent and server
share a machine. **Here they do not.** A `path` would resolve on the *service
host's* filesystem — failing, or silently reading an unrelated file. So
`_validate_attachments` raises a `ToolError` naming the constraint rather than
attempting a host read, and every description says inline base64 only. Do not
"fix" this by adding path support; the fix is `read_attachment`.

### 3. Auth lives in `auth.py` and nowhere else

`build_auth_provider(config) -> AuthProvider | None` is the whole auth surface.
Two modes — `static` (one bearer, loopback dev) and `google` (OAuth 2.1 resource
server). Nothing in `server.py` or `tools.py` may branch on the auth mode; if you
find yourself adding `if config.auth_mode` outside `auth.py`/`main()`, the seam is
leaking.

`None` is only reachable via `GEMDEX_MCP_HTTP_UNSAFE_NO_AUTH=true`; the config
layer refuses to boot an authless server otherwise, so the seam can't be
bypassed by simply omitting a token.

**`google` mode is a single-user allowlist, and that is the security boundary.**
Google authenticates *every* Google account, so `GoogleProvider` on its own is an
open door — `SingleUserGoogleProvider.verify_token` is what closes it. Three
things about it are load-bearing, and the mistake in each direction fails *open*:

1. **The check belongs in `verify_token`, not the OAuth flow.** Clients present a
   FastMCP-issued JWT that `OAuthProxy` swaps for the stored Google token on every
   call, so `verify_token` is the one choke point every authenticated request
   crosses. Filtering at authorization time instead would let an
   already-issued token outlive its removal from the allowlist.
2. **`email_verified` must be true.** An unverified Google email is
   self-asserted, so accepting it would let anyone claim the allowlisted address.
3. **`config.py` drops `client_token` in google mode.** Otherwise a leftover
   `GEMDEX_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` stays valid as a second credential that never consults
   the allowlist.

Both (1) and (2) depend on FastMCP internals — that `OAuthProxy.verify_token` is
the single entry point and that Google's `email` claim survives the token swap
into `AccessToken.claims`. **FastMCP's auth module is exempt from semver**, so
re-run `tests/test_auth_oauth.py` on every upgrade and treat a failure as a
security regression. Those tests were mutation-checked: neutering either the
email comparison or the `email_verified` guard makes them fail.

### 4. Custom routes are auth-exempt — `/mcp/sync/records` guards itself

**FastMCP's auth applies to the MCP endpoint, not to `@custom_route` handlers.**
Verified empirically: on a custom route the `Authorization` header arrives and
nothing has validated it — the request is *not* rejected the way a `/mcp` call
without a token is. `/healthz` relies on this (the compose healthcheck must not
need a token). A **write** route relying on it would be an unauthenticated
import endpoint on the public internet.

So `sync.py` calls `require_access_token()` first, which delegates to **the
configured provider's own `verify_token`**. That single line is why there is no
`if config.auth_mode` here: the static bearer and the google allowlist (including
its `email_verified` check) both apply through the same seam invariant #3
describes. A 401 answers with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="gemdex"` so an MCP
client knows to start the OAuth flow.

Two more properties of this route:

- **It lives under `/mcp/`, and that is load-bearing.** The reference edge routes
  `^/mcp` to this service and everything else to the web UI. A sibling
  `/sync/records` would fall through to the web UI and 404 — i.e. fail *open* on
  a misconfigured edge instead of loudly. Custom routes can nest under `/mcp`
  (confirmed against the live route table).
- **Ids must start with `chat:`.** The route exists for chat digests, whose ids
  are deterministic (`chat:<source>:<sessionId>`) so re-syncing a session upserts
  in place. Rejecting anything else keeps this from becoming a general-purpose
  "write any memory by arbitrary id" API. Unknown fields are dropped, ≤50 records
  per request, 100 MiB body cap.

**Why a route rather than a seventh tool:** sync needs upsert-on-deterministic-id
with `createdAt` preserved. `save_memory` mints a random id and `update_memory`
requires an existing one, so no combination of the six tools can express it —
only `/v1/import` can, and that is intentionally not on the agent surface. Adding
a sync *tool* would also hand every connected agent a write-by-id capability it
has no reason to have. `test_sync_route.py` asserts the tool list stays at six.

## Other gotchas

- **Six tools, no delete on this HTTP surface** — stdio MCP now has
  `delete_memory`; HTTP MCP deliberately still does not. `test_no_delete_tool`
  guards it. The sync route is not a tool and must not become one.
- **`ToolError`, never a raw exception.** Matches the TS handlers' "never throw
  to the protocol" rule; `GemdexTools._call` wraps every BYOI call so a transport
  failure becomes a readable tool error, not a crash.
- **The HTTP client is `httpx2`, not `httpx`.** MCP SDK v2 ships httpx2, and
  FastMCP raises httpx2 exceptions. An `except httpx.…` will import fine (httpx
  is often present transitively) and then silently never match.
- **`fastmcp==4.0.0b1` is a prerelease pin** with a `[tool.uv]
  constraint-dependencies` entry for `fastmcp-slim`. Never pin the `mcp` SDK to a
  prerelease — it breaks resolution. See the README's beta caveats.
- **Trust ranking is opt-in and off by default** (`GEMDEX_TRUST_RANKING=true`,
  read once at startup into `Config`). Off: fetch exactly `limit`, backend order
  untouched, no `trust=` in the score line — byte-identical to the flag-off TS
  path.
- **The Google OAuth client cannot be created from a CLI** — don't spend time
  trying. `gcloud iam oauth-clients` is Workforce Identity Federation (wrong
  system), the `gcloud alpha iap oauth-brands` API was shut down 2026-03-19, and
  the Firebase CLI has no OAuth-client verbs. Console only; see the README.
- **`scripts/smoke.py` writes a real memory** into the live BYOI pool (titled
  `gemdex-mcp-http smoke …`). It is an end-to-end acceptance check, not a dry
  run; `uv run pytest` is the offline suite and mocks the BYOI entirely.
- **This package is outside the pnpm workspace.** `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`build`
  do not see it; use `uv run pytest`.
- **`/healthz` must stay unauthenticated and must not probe the BYOI.** FastMCP
  exempts custom routes from auth middleware, which is the only reason the
  container healthcheck works in `google` mode (every `/mcp` call is a 401 by
  design). Adding a BYOI probe would make a public endpoint report backend
  availability, and would take this container down for another service's failure.
- **The container needs a writable state dir; `$HOME` is not one.**
  `FASTMCP_HOME` (OAuthProxy client registrations + encrypted upstream tokens)
  and `GEMDEX_STATS_PATH` (the outcome ledger) both default under `$HOME`, which
  is `/nonexistent` for the image's system user — with `read_only: true` the
  process dies at startup. `deploy/docker-compose.yml` points both at a named
  volume, and the Dockerfile pre-creates `/var/lib/gemdex` as uid 10001 so Docker
  seeds the volume with that ownership rather than root's. Both are real state:
  on tmpfs, every restart would force clients to re-register and re-authorize.
- **The image build context is the repo root**, matching `packages/server`:
  `docker build -f packages/mcp-http/Dockerfile .`. The deploy stack is
  [`deploy/`](../../deploy/README.md).
