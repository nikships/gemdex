# Gemdex Memory — desktop app

A native, **manage-only** desktop app for the [Gemdex](https://github.com/anand-92/gemdex)
memory layer, built in **SwiftUI** for macOS (Apple Silicon). It opens straight
into your memory layer to browse, create, edit, delete, export, and import
memories.

The Storage & Gemini panel can switch the sidecar between the embedded local
backend and a named BYOI Gemdex Server. It also shows the per-launch Gemini
readiness state and lets users validate, replace, or retry the local key. Remote
bearer tokens are accepted by the UI only for the configuration request,
persisted by the sidecar under `~/.gemdex/.env`, and never returned to the app.
The same panel can test remote health/authentication and import local memories
to the remote while preserving ids.

There is **no free-text search box** — recall is an agent/MCP capability. This
app is a fast local manager. (It does offer recall-*by-example*: a "Find
similar" action on any attachment, which runs media recall against the sidecar.)

## Gemini readiness and ingestion safety

Local mode is a **hard startup gate**. The sidecar performs a small real Gemini
embedding request on every launch; the manager does not mount until the key is
present and that request succeeds. Missing, rejected, and temporarily
unverifiable keys render a high-contrast blocking screen. A newly entered key is
validated before it is persisted, so a typo cannot replace a previously working
key.

Remote mode can open without a local key because the Gemdex Server owns memory
embeddings. Chat-history digestion still happens client-side, so remote mode
keeps a persistent red readiness warning and disables scan/start until a local
Gemini key is verified.

History ingestion is **always new-sessions-only**. Scans report previously
ingested sessions that later changed, but the UI exposes no override and the
core engine never includes those sessions in a run. This prevents accidental
re-digestion and overwrites across desktop, sidecar, and CLI entry points.

## Multimodal memories

Memories can carry inline media (image / audio / video / PDF). In the editor you
can drag-and-drop or pick files, give each a caption (which backs the BM25
keyword branch on recall), and remove them. The detail view renders images, an
audio player (AVKit), a video player (AVKit), and native inline PDF preview
(PDFKit). Bytes are streamed from the sidecar's
`GET /memories/:id/attachments/:attachmentId` route; "Find similar" posts the
attachment to `POST /recall` for recall-by-media.

Remote mode still talks only to the localhost sidecar. The app must never
connect directly to a configured Gemdex Server — the sidecar owns outbound
remote traffic because it can attach the stored bearer token without ever
exposing it to the app. The app receives only the per-launch localhost base URL
and request token via the sidecar handshake.

## Architecture

- **SwiftUI app** (`Sources/GemdexMemory/`): a native AppKit/SwiftUI window. It
  brings up the Node sidecar (`gemdex serve`), parses the
  `PORT=<n> TOKEN=<hex>` handshake line it prints to stdout, talks to it over
  localhost HTTP/JSON (`Services/APIClient.swift`), and tears it down on exit
  (`Services/SidecarManager.swift`). It owns the full sidecar lifecycle
  (probe / start / bundled-launch) but holds **no memory logic** — that lives in
  `gemdex-core`/`gemdex-mcp`.
- **Node sidecar** (`gemdex serve`, from the `gemdex-mcp` package): wraps
  `gemdex-core` + LanceDB and exposes a localhost HTTP/JSON manager API. Shares
  the same `~/.gemdex` store the MCP server uses, so memories saved by the agent
  show up here and vice-versa. Every request carries the per-launch
  `X-Gemdex-Token`; the server binds `127.0.0.1` only.

### Sidecar launch (no silent installs)

`SidecarManager.start()` picks a launch mode and the UI drives onboarding from
the published `phase`:

- **dev** — `GEMDEX_SERVE_CMD` set → run that Node entry directly.
- **bundled** — a release `.app` ships its own Node runtime + sidecar under
  `Contents/Resources/{node,sidecar}` (see *Zero-dependency packaging*). Launch
  prefers this and needs **no** user-installed Node.
- **probe** — otherwise, if `node` + `npx` resolve on the login-shell PATH, try
  `npx --offline gemdex-mcp serve` (cache-only, zero network). Handshake OK ⇒
  `ready`; cache miss ⇒ `needsBootstrap`.
- **needsNode** — no bundled runtime and no `node`/`npx` on PATH; the recovery
  screen shows an actionable error.

A user-approved bootstrap (`bootstrap(install:true)`) runs `npx -y gemdex-mcp
serve` (the one permitted network install) on a background thread and drops a
non-secret marker at `~/.gemdex/desktop.json`. Bundled release builds never need
this path.

## Zero-dependency packaging

A release `.app` is fully self-contained — a user on any Apple-Silicon Mac can
download the DMG and run the app with **zero** manual dependency installation:

- `macos/build-app.sh --with-sidecar` compiles the Swift binary, assembles the
  `.app`, and calls `macos/stage-sidecar.sh`, which downloads the official Node
  arm64 runtime and installs the packed `gemdex-core` + `gemdex-mcp` (prod deps
  only, including LanceDB's native arm64 binding) under
  `Contents/Resources/{node,sidecar}`.
- `macos/sign-app.sh` deep-signs every nested Mach-O: the bundled `*.node` /
  `*.dylib` (hardened runtime), the Node binary (hardened runtime **plus** the
  `allow-jit` / `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` entitlements V8 needs), then
  the outer app.

## Auto-updates (Sparkle)

The packaged macOS app ships with [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) for
in-place auto-updates of the `.app`. Sparkle only updates the app bundle; the
bundled sidecar is updated by shipping a new DMG.

- **Init:** `Services/UpdaterController.swift` wraps Sparkle's
  `SPUStandardUpdaterController`, compiled only when `GEMDEX_SPARKLE=1`
  (`#if SPARKLE_ENABLED`). Local/dev/screenshot builds omit Sparkle entirely so
  no framework is required.
- **Framework:** vendored under `third_party/sparkle/` (gitignored; pinned to
  2.9.2, fetched in CI). `Package.swift` links `Sparkle.framework` and adds the
  `@executable_path/../Frameworks` rpath when `GEMDEX_SPARKLE=1`.
- **Packaging:** `macos/embed-sparkle.sh` runs after `build-app.sh` and before
  the outer sign. It copies the framework into `Contents/Frameworks/`, injects
  `SUFeedURL` / `SUPublicEDKey` / `SUEnableAutomaticChecks` /
  `SUScheduledCheckInterval` into Info.plist, and codesigns Sparkle inside-out
  (XPC services + `Updater.app` + `Autoupdate` first, then the framework).
- **Feed:** the release workflow generates a `sign_update`-signed `appcast.xml`
  and publishes it alongside the DMG, so `SUFeedURL`
  (`…/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml`) always points at the newest build.
- **Keys:** the EdDSA public key lives in Info.plist (`embed-sparkle.sh`); the
  private key is the `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub Actions secret. Re-key with
  `third_party/sparkle/bin/generate_keys` and update both.

## Requirements (development)

- A **Swift 5.9+** toolchain (Xcode or CommandLineTools). The build uses
  SwiftPM (`swift build`) and a shell script to assemble the bundle, so a full
  Xcode/`xcodebuild` install is not required.
- A system Node (for `npx -y gemdex serve`), or set `GEMDEX_SERVE_CMD` to a
  local `gemdex-mcp` entry script for development.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment (the sidecar validates it on launch and
  uses it for local embedding), or enter and validate it in the in-app setup
  screen.

## Commands

```sh
# Build the .app bundle (no Sparkle, no bundled sidecar — fast dev loop):
bash macos/build-app.sh

# Build a self-contained release bundle (bundled Node + sidecar):
bash macos/build-app.sh --with-sidecar

# Build with Sparkle linked (requires third_party/sparkle):
GEMDEX_SPARKLE=1 bash macos/build-app.sh --with-sidecar

# Compile only (no bundle):
swift build -c release --arch arm64
```

## Dev against a local build

Point the app at your local `gemdex-mcp` build so you don't need the published
package or a bundled sidecar:

```sh
GEMDEX_SERVE_CMD=/abs/path/to/gemdex/packages/mcp/dist/index.js \
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key \
"build/Gemdex Memory.app/Contents/MacOS/GemdexMemory"
```

## Release

The unified `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on every push to `main` (and
via manual dispatch). It first patch-bumps the repo-wide version (the root
`VERSION` file, stamped into every package by `scripts/sync-version.mjs`), then
its `macos` job builds the bundled `.app`, embeds + signs Sparkle, deep-signs
the bundle, notarizes + staples, builds + notarizes the DMG, generates a signed
`appcast.xml`, and publishes both to a versioned `v<version>` GitHub release
marked as `latest`. `make_latest: true` keeps the `…/releases/latest/download/`
URLs baked into the app's `SUFeedURL` pointed at the newest build, and because
the version increments every release, Sparkle reliably detects the update. The
same workflow publishes `gemdex-core`/`gemdex-mcp`/`gemdex-server` to npm and
GitHub Packages at that identical version.
