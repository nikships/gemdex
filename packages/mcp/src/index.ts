const SAVE_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = `
Persist a new memory to the user's global, durable memory layer.

🎯 **When to use**: proactively, as you work — you do NOT need the user to ask.
Save durable, reusable knowledge the moment you learn it: hard-won fixes and
root causes, project conventions and architecture decisions, setup/build/deploy
steps, credentials and paths the user shares, gotchas, and the rationale behind
choices. If it's likely to matter in a future session or repo, store it now
without waiting for permission. Explicit user requests ("remember that…", "save
this") are just one trigger among many. Keep memories to durable, reusable facts
— skip one-off trivia and anything easily re-derived from the current context.

Behavior: the content is chunked, embedded via the selected text provider
(Gemini or local MLX), and stored globally
(searchable from every repo and session). Returns the new memory id.

Multimodal: optionally pass \`attachments\` (image/audio/video/PDF) to embed
media alongside the text. Each attachment is either a local file \`path\`
(preferred — the server reads + encodes the bytes, so you don't emit base64) or
inline base64 \`data\`. Requires the gemini-embedding-2 model. Either \`content\`
or at least one attachment is required.

If the response includes a "⚠ similar existing memories already stored" block,
the store found near-duplicate/conflicting memories already there — read it and
consolidate with \`update_memory\` (or confirm with the user which should win)
rather than leaving both.
`;

const RECALL_DESCRIPTION = `
Search the user's global memory layer by natural-language query and return a
cheap ranked title index (never full bodies).

🎯 **When to use**: proactively and by default — make checking memory a reflex,
not something you wait to be told to do. Recall at the start of a task, before
solving a problem, before setting up a tool or environment, before making a
design/convention decision, and before asking the user for information they may
have already given you. A title-index recall is cheap; prefer checking first
over assuming nothing is stored.

Behavior: hybrid semantic + BM25 search, fused by relevance. Always returns up
to 10 hits as title + id only (plus a track-record line when outcome stats
exist). Most tasks end here with nothing useful — that is expected. When a
title looks clearly task-relevant, open THAT memory with \`get_memory({ id })\`.
Do not expect bodies from this tool.

Setting \`GEMDEX_TRUST_RANKING=true\` re-ranks the title index by track record
(off by default; ranking stays pure relevance until you opt in).
`;

const GET_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = `
Load the full content of one stored memory by id.

🎯 **When to use**: after \`recall\` returns a title that looks clearly relevant
to the current task — or when you already have an exact id from \`save_memory\`.
This is the only MCP path that returns the full parent body. Most recalls need
no follow-up; only open memories you actually intend to use.

Behavior: returns title, id, relative age, optional track-record and attachment
metadata, and the full content. Use \`read_attachment\` afterward if you need
attachment/transcript bytes. Opening a memory counts as a recall for the
per-client outcome ledger (feeds track-record / optional trust ranking).
`;

const UPDATE_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = `
Revise an existing memory in place, identified by its id.

🎯 **When to use**: proactively whenever you discover a stored memory is
outdated, wrong, or duplicated — not only when the user asks
("the notarization step changed — update that memory"). If you learn a better
fact, or a \`save_memory\` response flags "⚠ similar existing memories already
stored", prefer correcting/consolidating the existing memory in place over
leaving stale or conflicting copies. Get the id from a prior save_memory,
recall, or get_memory result.

Two ways to change the text:
- \`edits\`: targeted find-and-replace — preferred for large memories. Pass an
  array of \`{ oldText, newText, replaceAll? }\`; you emit only the changed
  snippets instead of resending the whole note. Each \`oldText\` must match
  exactly and be unique (set \`replaceAll: true\` to change every occurrence).
- \`content\`: full replacement of the text. Use for small memories or rewrites.
\`content\` and \`edits\` are mutually exclusive.

Behavior: re-chunks and re-embeds the resulting content under the same id.
Omitted fields are preserved — leave out \`content\`/\`edits\` to keep the prior
text, leave out \`attachments\` to keep the prior media (pass \`attachments: []\`
to clear it). Each attachment is either a local file \`path\` (preferred) or
inline base64 \`data\`. To remove a memory entirely, use \`delete_memory\`.
`;

const REPORT_OUTCOME_DESCRIPTION = `
Report how acting on a recalled memory went, so the memory layer learns which
memories are trustworthy.

🎯 **When to use**: right after you used a recalled memory and the outcome is
clear — \`worked\` (followed it and it was correct), \`failed\` (its information
was wrong or broken), \`stale\` (clearly outdated, e.g. rotated credentials or
moved paths). One call per memory actually used; do not report memories you
merely saw in results. This is meta-feedback on the memory layer itself and is
the one gemdex tool you should call without being asked, whenever a clear
outcome exists.

Recorded locally in a per-client ledger keyed by memory id (not written back
into the memory itself). With \`GEMDEX_TRUST_RANKING=true\` it also adjusts
future \`recall\` ranking — proven memories rank higher, memories that have
burned the agent rank lower.
`;

const READ_ATTACHMENT_DESCRIPTION = `
Read the bytes of an attachment on a stored memory as text (UTF-8) or base64.

🎯 **When to use**: after \`get_memory\` shows a memory with attachments —
especially chat digests that include a \`file\` attachment captioned
"Full transcript (source file)". Prefer this over opening a local path when
running in remote mode (BYOI): the bytes live in the server blob store and are
fetched over HTTP. No GEMINI_API_KEY required.

Args: \`memory_id\` (required), optional \`attachment_id\` (omit when there is
exactly one attachment, or a single transcript/\`file\` attachment), optional
\`max_chars\` (default ~1.5M; truncates with a clear overflow note).
`;


const DELETE_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION = `
Permanently delete a stored memory by id (and its attachments/blobs).

🎯 **When to use**: when a memory is obsolete, wrong beyond repair, duplicated
after consolidation, or the user explicitly asks to forget something. Prefer
\`update_memory\` when the facts can be corrected in place. Get the id from a
prior save_memory, recall, or get_memory result.

Behavior: removes the memory from the backend (local LanceDB or remote BYOI
\`DELETE /v1/memories/:id\`). Also clears this client's per-memory outcome
stats for that id. Irreversible via MCP — confirm with the user when unsure.
