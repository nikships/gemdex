# deploy/ — reference self-host stack

The full **remote-agent** stack: BYOI memory API, the Streamable HTTP MCP
endpoint, and the browser manager UI — with only the MCP endpoint and the UI
exposed publicly over HTTPS.

**Just want it running?** [`scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh) automates
everything below — secrets, build, health, and a printed MCP client config:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikships/gemdex/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
# add --lan to reach it from other devices on your network
```

It defaults to `static` MCP auth and `dev` web auth, which is the right shape for
a LAN box and the wrong shape for the public internet — the guide below is the
upgrade to Google OAuth behind a TLS edge.

**For a public deployment start here:
[`docs/SELF_HOST_DEPLOY.md`](../docs/SELF_HOST_DEPLOY.md)** — the step-by-step
guide (Google OAuth, Cloudflare Tunnel / Caddy, rate limiting, and the checks
that prove Postgres and the BYOI bearer aren't public).

By hand:

```sh
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env   # then fill it in
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Contents

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | The stack: `postgres`, `gemdex-server` (loopback-only), `gemdex-mcp-http` (the agent surface), `gemdex-web` (the human surface). |
| `.env.example` | Every variable, with what it's for and how to generate it. |
| `scripts/ensure-up.sh` | Idempotent bring-up: waits for Docker (starts colima if needed), `up -d`, waits for health. Used by both boot units. |
| `docker-compose.lan.yml` | **Generated** by `install.sh --lan` (gitignored). Republishes MCP + web on `0.0.0.0`, never `gemdex-server`. Uses `ports: !override` because compose *merges* list keys — without it each service binds both `127.0.0.1` and `0.0.0.0` on one port and fails to start. |
| `launchd/com.gemdex.deploy.plist` | macOS always-on (Mac Mini). Runs at **login** — see the caveat in the guide. |
| `systemd/gemdex-deploy.service` | Linux always-on (VPS). Runs at boot. |

## How this differs from `packages/server/docker-compose.yml`

That one is the **BYOI-only** stack — what `npm run init` sets up and what the
desktop app talks to on a single machine. It stays as-is.

This one adds the MCP surface and is meant to sit behind a public edge. Separate
project name (`gemdex-deploy` vs `gemdex`) so both can run on one host, which
also means **separate volumes**: standing this up next to an existing BYOI stack
gives you an empty pool until you migrate the data. See
[Migrating an existing BYOI stack](../docs/SELF_HOST_DEPLOY.md#migrating-an-existing-byoi-stack).

## Two public surfaces, two audiences

| Service | Who it serves | Auth | Delete? |
|---------|---------------|------|---------|
| `gemdex-mcp-http` (`/mcp`) | AI agents | OAuth 2.1 resource server — the client brings a token | **No** — six tools, by design |
| `gemdex-web` (`/`) | you, in a browser | Google login → signed session cookie | **Yes** — the only delete surface |

Both gate on the same single `GEMDEX_ALLOWED_EMAIL` and can share one Google
OAuth client; each needs its own redirect URI registered. They are separate
containers because they authenticate different *kinds* of caller: a browser
cannot present a bearer token, and an agent should not be able to delete.

`gemdex-web` holds the BYOI bearer server-side and never sends it to the page —
that is what a backend-for-frontend is for. It is stateless (the session lives
in the browser's cookie), so it runs read-only with no volume.

It also has **no Gemini key**. Its session-upload page hands raw chat
transcripts to `gemdex-server`, which cleans and digests them — that container is
the only one holding the ingest pipeline, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and the database at
once, so the credential count is unchanged by the feature.

## The one invariant

**Postgres and the BYOI are never publicly reachable.** `postgres` has no host
port; `gemdex-server`, `gemdex-mcp-http`, and `gemdex-web` all publish on
`127.0.0.1` only, and the edge connects over loopback.

The BYOI bearer is a single long-lived secret with full access to every memory
and no per-user identity, so it must never be internet-routable. If you change a
`ports:` line here, re-run the verification steps in the guide — `0.0.0.0` in
`docker compose ps` means exposed to your whole network, and Docker writes
firewall rules directly, so it can bypass a UFW rule you thought covered you.
